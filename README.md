Why bother with Tensorflow/Keras/Pytorch when just numpy and some math can do the job ?

This repo implements a simple Neural Network architecture for classification purpose built using only `numpy`.

## Requirements

Only `numpy` is required as specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). However if you want to run the examples from [`docs/examples/`](docs/examples/) folder, you will need to install other packages specified in [doc/examples/requirements.txt](docs/examples/requirements.txt).
